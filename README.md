OVERVIEW:

My project is for people who like to treat themselves to getting pampered but do not want to go
to a beauty shop or do not have the time. They can can make bookings for treatments via phone or email from the contacts page.
They can also find the beautician via the social media links. So there are multiple ways to get in touch with the beautician.


UX:

The website is for people who would like a beautician who can come to their home, covers a local area and can work 
weekends and afternoon/evenings to accommodate their schedule.
There are several buttons to click onto see the different treatments and prices for these services also there is a gallery of previuos work
and ways to get in touch with the beautician.

As someone who is disabled and unable to travel to a salon it is a great resource to have a mobile beauty website to find someone that is certified and will travel 
to them and perform these treatments in the comfort of my own home at at time that suits me. I can view the website for the treatment I want and the price 
and get in touch to make a booking.

working a busy schedule and looking after the kids it is hard to find the time to get to to a Salon, thats where Rachels Mobile Beauty comes in handy, 
she is willing to travel to me in the eveinging/weekends and then i still get to spend that quality time i do have with my family.

WIREFRAMES:

This is an image of what my site first looked like. After some feed back from family members i change the whole website with some influnces from other websites i found
on google. As you can see the color schemes and layout have change completely and everything is easier to see and navigate. The images I first used were from imugr 
which are now no longer used only the image on the home page is from imugr and the rest are provided from the beauty therapist. I also changed the color scheme to a
white and light grey color so everything stands out more and doesn't look so crowed.

and possibly a different way for customers to book appoints.


TECHNOLOGIES USED:

<h3>TESTING:</h3>

I have manually tested the site extensivly by clicking on each tab and making sure each tab goes to the correct location and provides the correct information and also
doesn't open a new window so the back and forward buttons can be used. I have also click both facebook and instagram links on all pages to make sure the open a new window and 
connect to the relevant sites.
