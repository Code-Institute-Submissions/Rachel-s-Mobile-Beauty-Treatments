OVERVIEW:

My project is for people who like to treat themselves to getting pampered but do not want to go
to a beauty shop or do not have the time. They can can make bookings for treatments via phone or email from the contacts page.
They can also find the beautician via the social media links. So there are multiple ways to get in touch with the beautician.


UX:


The website is for people who would like a beautician who can come to their home, covers a local area and can work 
weekends and afternoon/evenings to accommodate their schedule.
There are several buttons to click onto see the different treatments and prices for these services also there is a gallery of previuos work
and ways to get in touch with the beautician.

As someone who is disabled and unable to travel to a salon it is a great resource to have a mobile beauty website to find someone that is certified and will travel 
to them and perform these treatments in the comfort of my own home at at time that suits me. I can view the website for the treatment I want and the price 
and get in touch to make a booking.

working a busy schedule and looking after the kids it is hard to find the time to get to to a Salon, thats where Rachels Mobile Beauty comes in handy, 
she is willing to travel to me in the eveinging/weekends and then i still get to spend that quality time i do have with my family.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

The project uses mainly HTML, CSS and BOOTSTRAP to implement and style the website.
Aslo font awesome and google fonts were used to add to the stle of the website.


TESTING:

I have manually tested the site extensivly by clicking on each tab and making sure each tab goes to the correct location and provides the correct information and also
doesn't open a new window so the back and forward buttons can be used. I have also click both facebook and instagram links on all pages to make sure the open a new window and 
connect to the relevant sites.

I deployed my project using github pages. After saving my work using the git commands of git add, git commit and git push I then went to options and to the github pages section
and selected source and then the master branch option then refreshed the pages to save I clicked on the link to the site to test and works perfectly.
