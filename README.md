                                         Rachel's Mobile Beauty Treatments
    

Overview:

My project is for people who like to treat themselves to getting pampered but do not want to go
to a beauty shop or do not have the time. They can can make bookings for treatments via phone or email from the contacts page.
They can also find the beautician via the social media links. So there are multiple ways to get in touch with the beautician.

UX:

The website is for people who would like a beautician who can come to their home, covers a local area and can work 
weekends and afternoon/evenings to accommodate their schedule.
There are several buttons to click onto see the different treatments and prices for these services also there is a gallery of previuos work
and ways to get in touch with the beautician.

As someone who is disabled and unable to travel to a salon it is a great resource to have a mobile beauty website to find someone that is certified and will travel 
to them and perform these treatments in the comfort of my own home at at time that suits me.

working a busy schedule and looking after the kids it is hard to find the time to get to to a Salon, thats where Rachels Mobile Beauty comes in handy, 
she is willing to travel to me in the eveinging/weekends and then i still get to spend that quality time i do have with my family.


of your own home at a time and day best suited to you.
